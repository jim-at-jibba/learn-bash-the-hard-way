# Learn Bash The Hard Way

An introduction to bash based on the 'hardway method'.

## The LxTHW Philosophy

'"Less Talk, More Code" summarizes the philosophy. By having students get code
working first, and explaining it second, you cut down on much of the difficulty
of explaining programming concepts to the uninitiated.

A LxTHW book simply has students do exercises, focuses on practice and rote
repetition, and instills an attitude that to learn anything one must be prepared
to work at it.'

## Assumptions

The reader is expected to have:

- A familiarity with the command line
- A familiarity with basic Linux commands
