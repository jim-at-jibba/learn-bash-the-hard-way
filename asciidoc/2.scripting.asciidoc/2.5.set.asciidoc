=== The 'set' Builtin

When using bash it is very important to understand what options are set, and
how this can affect the running of your scripts.

In this section you will become familiar with the 'set' builtin, which allows
you to manipulate these options within your scripts.

==== Running 'set'

You start by running 'set' on its own:

----
1$ set
----

This will produce a stream of output that represents the state of your shell.
In the normal case, you will see all the variables and functions set in your
environment.

But my bash man page says:

[quote,bash man page]
____
Without options, the name and value of each shell variable are displayed in a format that can be reused as input for setting or resetting the currently-set variables. Read-only variables cannot be reset. In posix mode, only shell variables are listed.
____

NOTE: The **Portable Operating System Interface**(**POSIX**) is a family of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization[standards] specified by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computer_Society[IEEE Computer Society] for maintaining compatibility between https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system[operating systems].

Can you work out from your 'set' output whether you are in posix mode?

It is likely that you are not. If so, type:

----
2$ bash
3$ set -o posix
4$ set
5$ exit
----

and you will observe that the output no longer has functions in it. The '-o' switched on the 'posix' option in your bash shell. The same command with '+o' will switch it off. I have trouble remembering which is 'on' and which is 'off' every time!

NOTE: If you did not have functions, then either no functions were set, or you were in posix mode
already!

The commands above put you in a fresh bash shell so that we would revert to the previous state.

To show how all your options are set type this:

----
6$ set -o
----

and you should see the current state of all your options.

What you see are all the options bash can set. One of the exercises is to try to understand what they all mean, but right now we're only going to focus on a couple.

==== 'set' vs 'env'

One thing that can confuse people is that the output of 'set' is similar to the output of 'env', but different.

----
7$ env
----

The difference is that _exported_ variables are shown by env, not all the variables set in the shell.


==== Useful Options for Scripting

Where set becomes really useful to understand is in scripting.

For example, I set these two up every time I start writing a shell script:

----
8$ set -o errexit
9$ set -o xtrace
----

Although you don't need to be in a script for them to work.

The errexit option tells bash to exit the script if any command fails.

The xtrace option outputs the

Type this is to see how this works in practice:

----
10$ echo '#!/bin/bash
set -o errexit
set -o xtrace
pwd
cd $HOME
cd -
false
echo "should not get here"' > ascript.sh
11$ chmod +x ascript.sh
12$ ./ascript.sh
----

You should be able to explain the output of the above.

===== Flags With 'set' Instead of Names

For each 'set' option, you can use a flag instead. For example, this:

----
13$ set -e
14$ set -x
----

is the same as:

----
15$ set -o errexit
16$ set -o xtrace
----

I generally prefer the name form rather than flag, just because it's easier to read.

When I start writing a script, I usually start with the following:

----
#!/bin/bash

set -o errexit
set -o xtrace
set -o unset

[...]
----

The 'unset' throws an error if a variable is unset when referenced. (The special variables $@ and $* are exempt).

==== The 'pipefail' Option, Exit Codes and Pipelines

TODO

----
17$ grep notthere afile.txt | xargs echo
18$ echo $?
----


----
19$ set +o pipefail
20$ grep notthere afile.txt | xargs echo
21$ echo $?
----

===== Cleanup

Now clean up what you just did:

----
22$ rm afile.txt
23$ rm ascript.sh
----

==== Exercises

1) Read the man page to see what all the options are. Don't worry if you don't
understand it all yet, just get a feel for what's there.

2) Set up a shell with unique variables and functions and use set to create a script to recreate those items in another shell.
