In this section I cover concepts and techniques that form the basis of daily usage of bash. They can be considered 'tips' for bash usage and somewhat optional, but come up often enough for me to think it important to cover in a practical guide.

In it we cover:

- Terminal codes and non-standard characters

- Setting up your prompt

- 'Here' docs

- The bash command history
