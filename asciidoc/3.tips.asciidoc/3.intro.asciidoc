TRICKS / HANDY

In here are the most commonly-used techniques I use on a regular basis.

   Event Designators
       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list.

       !      Start a history substitution, except when followed by a blank, newline, carriage return, = or ( (when the extglob shell option
              is enabled using the shopt builtin).
       !n     Refer to command line n.
       !-n    Refer to the current command line minus n.
       !!     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.
       !string
              Refer to the most recent command starting with string.
       !?string[?]
              Refer to the most recent command containing string.  The trailing ? may be omitted if string is followed immediately by a new-
              line.
       ^string1^string2^
              Quick substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing string1 with string2.  Equivalent  to  ``!!:s/string1/string2/''  (see
              Modifiers below).
       !#     The entire command line typed so far.
