       read [-ers] [-u fd] [-t timeout] [-a aname] [-p prompt] [-n nchars] [-d delim] [name ...]
              One  line  is  read  from the standard input, or from the file descriptor fd supplied as an argument to the -u option, and the
              first word is assigned to the first name, the second word to the second name, and so on, with leftover words and their  inter-
              vening  separators  assigned  to the last name.  If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the remaining
              names are assigned empty values.  The characters in IFS are used to split the line into words.  The  backslash  character  (\)
              may  be  used to remove any special meaning for the next character read and for line continuation.  Options, if supplied, have
              the following meanings:
              -a aname The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable aname, starting at 0.  aname is unset before any new values are assigned.  Other name arguments are ignored.
              -d delim - The first character of delim is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.
              -e - If the standard input is coming from a terminal, readline (see READLINE above) is used to obtain the line.
              -n nchars - read returns after reading nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input.
              -p prompt - Display  prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any input.  The prompt is dis- played only if input is coming from a terminal.
              -r     Backslash does not act as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part of the line.  In  particular,  a backslash-newline pair may not be used as a line continuation.
              -s     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
              -t timeout - Cause  read to time out and return failure if a complete line of input is not read within timeout seconds.  This option has no effect if read is not reading input from the terminal or a pipe.
              -u fd  Read input from file descriptor fd.

              If no names are supplied, the line read is assigned to the variable REPLY.  The return code is  zero,  unless  end-of-file  is encountered, read times out, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.
