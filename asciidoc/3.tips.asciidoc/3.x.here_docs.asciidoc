   Here Documents
       This  type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only word (with no trail-
       ing blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command.

       The format of here-documents is:

              <<[-]word
                      here-document
              delimiter

       No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on word.  If any characters in
       word  are quoted, the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.  If word
       is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  In
       the latter case, the character sequence \<newline> is ignored, and \ must be used to quote the characters \, $, and `.

       If  the redirection operator is <<-, then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing delimiter.
       This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.
