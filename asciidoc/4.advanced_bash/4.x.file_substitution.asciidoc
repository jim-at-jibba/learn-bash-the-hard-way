== File Substitution


=== Simple File Substitution

diff output of two commands.

Normal

Two similar looking directories:

/bin and /usr/bin

normally you would create two files and diff them, which can get cumbersome.

A useful shortcut...


                                                                                                                                         
//file substitution <()

Process Substitution

Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (FIFOs) or the /dev/fd method of naming open files.  It takes  the  form  of  <(list)  or  >(list).   The process  list is run with its input or output connected to a FIFO or some file in /dev/fd.  The name of this file is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.  If the >(list) form is used, writing to the file will provide input for list.  If the <(list) form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of list.
