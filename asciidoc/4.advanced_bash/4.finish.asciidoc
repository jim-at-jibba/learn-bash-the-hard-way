== Finished!

Well done! You've finished the course.

The course's aims were to give you an understanding of key concepts of bash so
that you are:

- aware of what bash can do

- develop your understanding of central bash concepts

- 

If I had to put it in a sentence, I'd say that this course should give you the
ability to never be surprised or helpless in the face of bash you come across.

I hope that's what you got from the course!

I welcome feedback and comment to ian.miell@gmail.com
