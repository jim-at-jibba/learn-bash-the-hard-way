In this section you will learn about some more advanced bash topics.

In it, we cover:

- Trapping signals

- Debugging techniques, and making your scripts more robust

- String manipulation

Finally, you will look at a real-world bash program that implements a simple
continuous integration process, and see how the techniques learned in this
course can be applied.
