=== Introduction

==== What is bash?

Bash is a shell program.

A shell program is typically an executable binary that takes commands that you
type and (once you hit return), translates those commands into (ultimately)
system calls to the Operating System API.

==== Other shells

Other shells include:

- sh
- ash
- dash
- ksh
- csh
- tclsh

These other shells have different rules, conventions, logic, and histories that
means they can look similar.

Bash is called the 'Bourne Again SHell'. It is a descendant of the Thompson
Shell and then the 'sh' shell.
