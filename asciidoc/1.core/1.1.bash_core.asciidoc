=== Introduction

==== What is bash?

Bash is a shell program.

A shell program is typically an executable binary that takes commands that you
type and (once you hit return), translates those commands into (ultimately)
system calls to the Operating System API.

==== Other shells

Other shells include:

- sh
- ash
- dash
- ksh
- csh
- tclsh

These other shells have different rules, conventions, logic, and histories that
means they can look similar.

Because other shells are also programs, they can be run from in each other!

Here you run csh from within your bash terminal. Note that you get a different
prompt (by default):


//TODO some difference between csh and bash (google it)
----
1$ csh
2% 
----

Typically, a csh will give you a prompt with a percent sign, while bash will
give you a prompt with a dollar sign. This is configurable, though, so your
setup may be different.

==== History of bash

This diagram helps give a picture of the history of bash:

image::diagrams/shell_history.gif[scaledwidth="50%",height=200]

Bash is called the 'Bourne Again SHell'. It is a descendant of the Thompson
Shell and then the Bourne 'sh' shell. Bash has other 'siblings' (eg ksh),
'cousins' (eg tcsh), and 'children', eg 'zsh'.

The details aren't important, but it's important to know that different shells
exist and they can be related and somewhat compatible.

Bash is the most widely seen and used shell as of 2017. However, it is still
not uncommon to end up on servers that do not have bash!
